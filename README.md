# terminal-launcher
Android launcher based on command line UI

A tiny project I made for a weekly competition on [/r/androidthemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidthemes/comments/6p1tpu/wcfunctional_working_terminal/?st=jgi702p5&sh=190c3002)

Not a real terminal emulator, just a really, really barebones launcher. Was a cool idea but didn't find personally find it practical as a full-time launcher. Might be more useful for Android TV or laptop. 

Uploaded with MIT license in case someone wants to take this and make it into a real app.
